# Your piggy bank on the blockchain

## What is this?
A set of contracts and DAPP that allows you store money for specific periods of time and then send them off to another wallet. 

It can be used as:
- Piggy bank
- Savings
- Micro charity donations

## When token?
No token! be gone from here!

## Has this been security audited? 
Next question please.

## How does this work?
You `setup` your bank with a `destination` that the funds will be sent to upon arrival of the `transferTime` and in `recurringInDays` intervals there after. 

You pay into the contract by regular transfer to the contract. On arrival of `transferTime` and the recurring periods, the balance will be sent to the destination specified on setup.
